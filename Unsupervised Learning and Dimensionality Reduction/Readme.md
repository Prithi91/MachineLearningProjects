The project aims to compare and study the performance of various unsupervised learning algorithms viz., Kmeans and EM and Dimensionality Reduction algorithms viz., Principal Components Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, RP and SVD. 
The Study was done on two clustering problems.

# Breast Cancer
Problem1 attempts to study the effects of breast cancer on the proteomic(protein expression) landscape of those affected by breast cancer. Somatic(genetic) mutations have been extensively
characterized in breast cancer and such mutations change the protein expression landscape of affected persons. The dataset, obtained from kaggle presents 77 breast cancer samples with
roughly 12000 protein values for each of the samples. Analysing the proteomic landscape helps identify certain subtypes of breast cancer as opposed to the subtypes identified by the
conventional RNA-expression based clustering. The RNA based clustering identifies 4 subtypes of cancer and has been used as a benchmark for comparing the clustering achieved based on
proteomic data. The need to identify subtypes different from the conventional ones arises in order to distinguish therapeutic targets from non treatable ones.

# Avila
Problem 2 is a multilabel classification problem involving the Avila data set from UCI. The dataset has been extracted from 800 images of the ‘Avila Bible’, an XII century giant Latin copy of the Bible. The prediction task is to associate each
pattern of the script to a copyist. The features include numerical data such as intercolumnar distance, margins, interlinear spacing, etc. There are 12 classes to which the data belong to and
the distribution is imbalanced with the majority class representing 4286 instances and the minority class representing 5 instances.
